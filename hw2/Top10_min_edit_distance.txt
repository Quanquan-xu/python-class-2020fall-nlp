 RZA is Crazy    The Corsair  has many media obsessions but one of his favorites is  RZA . The RZA is crazy. Nutso. He eats ungodly amounts of  urlLink colloidal silver , even  proffering it to his offspring  need we say more?   One day  RZA  and his babies are going to turn blue from a colloidal silver overdose and then people will take me seriously.  Anyhoo : here's what he had to say to  FHM :   FHM : How strong is your Kung Fu?   RZA : "Strong, but I've never used it. One of my uncles trains CIA agents. He was offended I was learning from someone else, so he showed me this one move. He said, 'I could cripple you.' I believed him but he had to prove it. I was hurt for three months."  Okay ... leaving aside the implausibility that one of RZA's uncles is in the intelligence gathering business, how many people out there have familial relations that whisper  urlLink Moon Knight -like threats.  Being family is not about crippling one another . The interview concludes:   FHM : Is there an RZA sex tape out there?   RZA : I don't leave evidence like that. I form the lense with my hand, look through it and tape record with my mind.  What-the- fuck ?!

 The Charlie Rose Drinking Game    The art of the interview is to draw out the subject while the interviewer recedes into the background. Although  Charlie Rose  delivers the goods on any given weekday, he uses the first person singular personal pronoun often.  Excedingly  often. Okay: all the damned time. Charlie, thank you for giving us those great interviews with  Will Ferrell  and  Luca Cordero di Montezemolo , but honestly:  It's not all about you . All those  I's  and  me's  Charlie; it's not all about you.   So, in the spirit of Charlie Rose's energetic use of the first person singular personal pronoun,  The Corsair  proposes  The Charlie Rose Drinking Game . It's late at night, it was a hard day at work, you are about to go to bed and Charlie is interviewing some Master of the Universe -- so why not have a drinkie poo on everyones favorite social climber- cum-interviewer? Every time Charlie uses the first person singular personal pronoun, down a shot.    And don't use any of the cheap stuff , ladies and gentlemen, this is Charlie Rose we're talking about, and that whole "corridors of power Illuminati Trilateral Commission" power nexus. One doesn't just down muscatel with Charlie Rose; you better  recognize .   If you are still conscious after the drinking game, then you are a candidate for the  Jared Paul Stern  Ironman Drinkie-poo competition.

 The Condi Rice 9/11 Testimony Drinking Game (Thanks, Wonkette)    National Security Advisor  Condi Rice's  testimony will probably have as much gravity as  urlLink Watergate , as well it should. The 9/11 Commission is trying to find out what went wrong, how did the worst terrorist attack in our history catch us off guard? Finding those answers is the job of the Commission.   And what of us? What of we policy geeks who called in sick to our jobs (*cough, cough*) so that we could watch (family emergency) this historic moment (stomach virus) uninterrupted by  work ?   Drink , my sweet readers; let the  urlLink Cutty Sark  cut the gravity.  urlLink Wonkette had the idea , but because the day got away from her, I felt I should give it a shot. I give to you, dear reader, with special mention to Wonkette for the idea,  The Condi Rice 9/11 Commission Drinking Game :   Take one drink if:    ... Condi refers to White House documentation: memos, e-mails or agenda items  ... Condi says she wants to "work with the Commission" (every time she does)    Take two drinks if:    ... Condi's opening statement goes beyond 20 minutes  ... Condi puts down  Richard Clarke    Pound it if:    ... Former Senator  urlLink Bob Kerry  makes an outrageous statement  ... A Republican on the panel tells Bob Kerry that he is being partisan  ... Condi puts down the Clinton Administration  ... The Commission breaks into verbal jousting among themselves

 Andrew Cuomo: The Art of Losing   "The agony of defeat. It seems magnified in a political election, that modern day crusade and zero-sum game. There is no silver medal award for finishing second. Elections consume body and soul.  "My race was great political theater. I was running last year in a primary to defeat George Pataki, who defeated my father Mario Cuomo. The New York press had choreographed the campaign into an Italian opera in which the son was to avenge the father's death. There was no romance in the opera: father dies, and son dies.  "Political loss is unique in that it is public and pervasive. There is no need to whisper in the kitchen 'honey, I didn't get the promotion' after an unsuccessful political campaign, everone knows you lost.  "For me, the pervasive nature of loss became real one day after my withdrawal from the New York governor's race when I was at a gas station. I pulled into a self service station and removed the gas cap. I was excercising all the deliberate caution not to dirty my suit or my tie, which have a proclivity to position itself as a bib for the gas nozzle. I was attempting my personal innovation: wedging the gas cap into the nozzle to avoid having to hold the handle. As this is not easily done, I made several attempts in which the cap fell down and rolled to some inaccessible spot, causing me to have to retrieve it, moving delicately to avoid dirtying myself.  "At this point I looked across the island to see the customer on the other side watching my exhibition. The patron across the way looked at me and said, 'Boy Andrew, losing really stinks -- you even have to pump your own gas.  "Everyone knew. There was no hiding."   Crossroads , Introducion by  Andrew Cuomo .

 Tucker Carlson On Fame   "Hardest of all to get used to, though, was the loss of anonymity in public. Working in television is like having your picture in the Post office. People you've never seen before know what you look like.  "I didn't fully comprehend the consequences of this until I flew to Italy for a friends wedding. Thanks to bad weather I wound up spending quite a bit of time in the Paris airport. One beer led to another, and by the time I boarded the flight to Florence, I'd definitely been drinking. I wasn't embarrassingly wino drunk, though I was dirty and unshaven. I was, however, impared enough not to notice that there was a large Moroccan man seated between me and the aisle.  "Not long after takeoff, I had to go to the bathroom fairly desperately. (Savvy travellers, I've since learned, don't drink four liters of beer before getting on airplanes). By this time, the Moroccan guy was asleep, completely passed out and snoring. Rather than wake him I decided to climb over his seat. Stepping from one armrest to the other, I made it successfully.  "I had no such luck on my way back. Years later I convinced myself that the plane had turbulence just as I was standing over the sleeping man. I'll never know for sure. I do know that somehow I lost my balance and wound up falling knees-first into his lap.  "He woke up screaming. I didn't understand the precise meaning of his words, but I got the general point. He yelled in the intercontinental language of pain, fear and confusion. I tried to apologize, but this seemed to make him more agitated.   "He didn't stop shouting until I got off his lap, which wasn't easy. It was a loud moment.  "But not so loud I couldn't hear my own name spoken in a stage whisper from three rows back. It was a group of American tourists. They were staring at me. "That's definitely him," said one. "I saw him on CNN last week."   Tucker Carlson ,  Politics, Partisans and Parasites.

 Smackdown: Dick Morris vs Bill Clinton   From  Behind the Oval Office , by  Dick Morris  p. 64-5:  "At about midnight, (then Governor Bill) Clinton  joined Hillary,  Gloria Cabe , his campaign manager, and me in a cozy breakfst room off the kitchen. My polling (for a 1990 gubernatorial reelection fight) showed that  McRae  offensive (Bill's ooponent) had dropped Clinton's share vote to a meage 43 percent. Generally, when an incumbent's share of the polls dropped below 50 percent in the polls, it means he is likely to lose ... Clinton's temper got the better of him. Exhausted, worried, and angry, he exploded. 'You got me into this race,' he screamed, 'so you could make some extra money off me. That was the only reason. And now you give me no attention, no attention at all. I'm about to lose this election, this primary, against a nobody' ... Clinton has a terrible temper ... In pain and facing that harsh criticism, I lost my temper too. If he was too hasty in his criticism, I was too sharp in my reply. Storming out of the breakfast room  through the kitchen toward the door outside, I rallied, 'Thank you, thank you, thank you. You've just solved my problem. I'm getting shit from Atwater and shit from Lott for working for you, and now I can solve my problem. Go fuck yourself. I'm quitting your goddamn campaign, and now I am a free agent. I can be a fifty state Republican and don't have to take your shit.'  "Clinton charged up behind me as I stalked towards the door, grabbed me from behind, and wrapped his arms around me to stop me from leaving. I slipped to the floor. Hillary helped me to my feet. The moment I stood up Clinton became apologetic. 'Don't go, don't go I'm sorry. Don't go, I;m sorry,' he said as I walked out the door, slamming it behind me.. Hillary ran after me to calm me down. She put her arms around my shoulders and walked me around the grounds of the mansion. "Please forgive him," she pleaded. 'He's under so much pressure. He didn't mean it. He's very sorry. He's overtired, he hasn't slept well in days. He's not himself. He values you. He needs you,' she repeated.  "I calmed down enough to drive to my hotel, and I called Eileen (his wife) shaking in rage. Later Hillary called to tell me how much Bill wanted me back. Then he came on line to apologize ... I couldn't leave Clinton three weeks before his primary, but from then on I dealt with him in a formal, almost frosty way. I stopped calling him Bill, always adressed him as Governor, and left when our meetings were over rather than hang around and chat."

 President Al Sharpton: The First Few Days   As you can see, the progressive buildup to the Iowa caucus has thrown me off my usually sophisticated pop-culturally obsessed game, and gotten me all  sexed up  on  politics .  Blame Iowa ! Bear with me, though,  my little pomegranates , I  will  come out of this little poly-sci funk intact and, on the other side of the caucus, back in rare form.  My  fascination du jour , though, if you must know, is the  urlLink Reverend Al Sharpton .   And why not : His campaign is quixotic, to be sure, but there is also quite a bit of  pathos  and some, well,  humor  in it.   Actually, there is lots of humor in his candidacy if you know  how  to look. Sharpton has come away -- post  SNL  -- as a sort of  Falstaffian  American character (charicature?), more perfectly suited to  Comedy Central  than the rigors of the campaign trail. Perhaps he might consider following  Jon Stewart , or a late night show on  VH1  opposite  Charlie Rose ?   But all this talk of pitching Al for Prime Time is premature. Although Sharpton  urlLink couldn't win DC , what's to say he's going to flame out in his other hopeful state,  urlLink South Carolina .    What if  he were to  win  South Carolina by snagging the majority of black votes in a tight four way race.  And : what if,  say , conservatives vote for Al  en masse  in open primary states? And what if he won the Democratic nomination as a result of the votes of his loyalists  plus  those of conservative spoilers!  (oh dear, I can already feel my readership beginning to snooze at the sheer  geekiness  of this)  And  then , what if -- just bear with me, now --  what if : Al went on to win the Presidency, buoyed by the  drunken frat boy vote  as well as  merry pranksters across the country  who want to see The Grand Old Party become, well, a  par-tay . Isn't humor ultimately more attractive to the masses? I mean, would you really rather hang out with  Jim Carrey  and  David Chapelle  or  Paul O'Neill  and  Pat Buchanan ,  hmm ?   Highly implausible , you say to a  Reverend President Al Sharpton . Well, I agree. But what if ... what  if  ... (dream sequence music trails off into ...)    January 20, 2005 : A visibly distraught  Chief Justice Rehnquist   administers the oath of office to  Reverend Al Sharpton , who becomes the 44th President of the United States. Immediately following the swearing in, Rehnquist has,  simultaneously , a nervous breakdown and a stroke at  urlLink the thought of an African American  President.  At the inaugural ball, Rehnquist exhibits a  spastic rigor  in his dance (" his freaky stylee ," would be inaugural invitee  Coolio's  take on the spectacle in the next day's  Washington Post ) that was generally taken to be a result of  drunken  revelry. Only later, after the last dance as Rehquist writhed on the floor, did attendees realize that The Ren had not  actually  been engaged in highly  elaborate  breakdancing maneuvers, but was, indeed, in a perilous plight.  Sandra Day O'Connor  would sum up the majority opinion in the  New York Times  by observing, solemnly, "all involved didn't know the seriousness of the matter. We believed that he had passed the bar ... about six or seven times too many."  James Brown performs " urlLink Hot Pants " instead of the traditional "hail to the Chief."   January 22, 2005 : The Andrew Jacksonesque populist appoints  Richard Simmons  as  Surgeon General  and  Chairman of the President's Council of Physical Fitness .   Immediately following, Simmons, The Reverend President and the Religious Right form a joint task force on fundamentalism and excercise called,  Sweatin' to the Holies .  Instead of the partisan Republican Prayer Breakfasts, Democrats and Republicans seeking early morning face time with the President must excercise to gospel and Christian Contemporary hits while being prodded on by  Surgeon General Simmons . The President notes: there will be no breaking of bread ... too many carbs ...  we are all on Atkins , you know.   January 24, 2005 : The Godfather of Soul is appointed Ambassador to the Holy See. "The Pope can no longer call us a nation turning it's back on its soul anymore," the President quips.  February 1, 2005: The President recieves a delegation of Hindi Ascetics, but after, rather  pornographically , mispronouncing their religious title, the " fakirs ," who have lived a life devoted to peace, abruptly exit the Oval Office in a swarm of  obscenities  and  curses  involving the President's mother.  February 2, 2005:  Tina Brown  officially begins sucking up to the new President.   Or something along those lines . How  fun  would a Reverend Al Presidency be?

February 1, 2005: The President recieves a delegation of Hindi Ascetics, but after, rather  pornographically , mispronouncing their religious title, the " fakirs ," who have lived a life devoted to peace, abruptly exit the Oval Office in a swarm of  obscenities  and  curses  involving the President's mother.  February 2, 2005:  Tina Brown  officially begins sucking up to the new President.   Or something along those lines . How  fun  would a Reverend Al Presidency be?
