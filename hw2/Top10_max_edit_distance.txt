 The Chattering Class Virtual Year Book    Far be it from me , lowly blogger, to impede the progress of all the  primping  and  preening  that goes on among the chattering classes. I mean, they do deserve their time to waddle in the sun being as they explain reality to the rest of the world daily, via their nesting centers in NY, DC and LA, and occasionally  urlLink Davos  and Sundance.  Sometimes the chattering class appear to be unruly students at  urlLink J K Rowlings'  mythical  Hogwarts , struggling in childlike wonder with The Great Questions of Good and Evil --- naked ambition versus the ermine robes of state.  Imagine, if you will,  urlLink Eisner  or, say,  Michael Powell , as  urlLink Voldemortian  forces lying in wait in support of media consolidation! Not too much of a wizarding stretch, I hope.  Now,  take away the element of magic  and at other times, The Chattering Classes appear to be not unlike the  urlLink birds . Imagine if you will,  Barry Diller  a  urlLink heron , or  Anna Wintour  a  urlLink swan , pecking at a salad,  Jayson Blair  (averted gaze) a  urlLink turkey  ("performs distraction display") and  Harvey Weinstein  an  urlLink American Kestrel  ("Pale belly"). My bird's eye view. That's just how  The Corsair's  fevered media-oversaturated imagination works: all  wizards and warblers .  The Chattering Class render their ideas in varying forms of, uhm, media: sometimes they use the standard black and white print, often radio waves, other times tv, glossy mags are the usual, even mini studios--  whatever  the means of communication, there is some hawkish champion ready to express themselves, so, in the end, it is  difficult  to characterize The Mediaratti fully as the variety of media are matched only by the infinitude of styles and thought, limited only by the imagination; and, of course, I don't intend (or  pre tend) to be the last word on the matter-- neither as Hogwarts' sorting hat nor as Audubonian birder on the prowl.  Nor  do I, in any way, mean this to be a  complete list , but only a partial listing of those flapping wings who have crossed my radar screen.   So, like the snarky and chaotic (I think the very cool  urlLink Choire  called me absolutely mad, and I don't dispute that claim)  urlLink Gemini  that I am, allow me to mix my metaphors, combining Rowlings and Ravens, to try and draw a bede on these venerable birds.    Basta , now let's just coalesce all the necessary, fluttering data, my little pomegranates, and see if we cannot usher these rara avis into an aviary fitting for public  consumption , uhm -- only  urlLink the catty consume birds  -- public  observation .   And so , I present, as it were, on the fly, a virtual HS yearbook (the school song a martial, Murdochian anthem, possibly in  urlLink Mandarin Chinese ?), without the pictures:   For your pleasure ,  urlLink Rupert Murdoch  HS, Class of 2004 (stands at attention, hums anthem solemnly):   roll credits    Who's Who :   Barry Diller , Headmaster,  urlLink Dumbledoresque  mogul standing athwart  urlLink media consolidation  ... white  urlLink tailed tropic bird ("In pursuit of fish and squid, tropicbirds engage in graceful dives from the air.")   urlLink Don Imus  ... shifty-eyed leathery janitorial-type (think of the creepy Carl the Janitor in  urlLink The Breakfast Club ) ...  urlLink Masked Booby  ("a variety of hissing and quacking notes on breeding grounds") ...  urlLink Slytherin  ...

 The Chattering Class Virtual Year Book    Far be it from me , lowly blogger, to impede the progress of all the  primping  and  preening  that goes on among the chattering classes. I mean, they do deserve their time to waddle in the sun being as they explain reality to the rest of the world daily, via their nesting centers in NY, DC and LA, and occasionally  urlLink Davos  and Sundance.  Sometimes the chattering class appear to be unruly students at  urlLink J K Rowlings'  mythical  Hogwarts , struggling in childlike wonder with The Great Questions of Good and Evil --- naked ambition versus the ermine robes of state.  Imagine, if you will,  urlLink Eisner  or, say,  Michael Powell , as  urlLink Voldemortian  forces lying in wait in support of media consolidation! Not too much of a wizarding stretch, I hope.  Now,  take away the element of magic  and at other times, The Chattering Classes appear to be not unlike the  urlLink birds . Imagine if you will,  Barry Diller  a  urlLink heron , or  Anna Wintour  a  urlLink swan , pecking at a salad,  Jayson Blair  (averted gaze) a  urlLink turkey  ("performs distraction display") and  Harvey Weinstein  an  urlLink American Kestrel  ("Pale belly"). My bird's eye view. That's just how  The Corsair's  fevered media-oversaturated imagination works: all  wizards and warblers .  The Chattering Class render their ideas in varying forms of, uhm, media: sometimes they use the standard black and white print, often radio waves, other times tv, glossy mags are the usual, even mini studios--  whatever  the means of communication, there is some hawkish champion ready to express themselves, so, in the end, it is  difficult  to characterize The Mediaratti fully as the variety of media are matched only by the infinitude of styles and thought, limited only by the imagination; and, of course, I don't intend (or  pre tend) to be the last word on the matter-- neither as Hogwarts' sorting hat nor as Audubonian birder on the prowl.  Nor  do I, in any way, mean this to be a  complete list , but only a partial listing of those flapping wings who have crossed my radar screen.   So, like the snarky and chaotic (I think the very cool  urlLink Choire  called me absolutely mad, and I don't dispute that claim)  urlLink Gemini  that I am, allow me to mix my metaphors, combining Rowlings and Ravens, to try and draw a bede on these venerable birds.    Basta , now let's just coalesce all the necessary, fluttering data, my little pomegranates, and see if we cannot usher these rara avis into an aviary fitting for public  consumption , uhm -- only  urlLink the catty consume birds  -- public  observation .   And so , I present, as it were, on the fly, a virtual HS yearbook (the school song a martial, Murdochian anthem, possibly in  urlLink Mandarin Chinese ?), without the pictures:   For your pleasure ,  urlLink Rupert Murdoch  HS, Class of 2004 (stands at attention, hums anthem solemnly):   roll credits    Who's Who :   Barry Diller , Headmaster,  urlLink Dumbledoresque  mogul standing athwart  urlLink media consolidation  ... white  urlLink tailed tropic bird ("In pursuit of fish and squid, tropicbirds engage in graceful dives from the air.")   urlLink Don Imus  ... shifty-eyed leathery janitorial-type (think of the creepy Carl the Janitor in  urlLink The Breakfast Club ) ...  urlLink Masked Booby  ("a variety of hissing and quacking notes on breeding grounds") ...  urlLink Slytherin  ...

 The Chattering Class Virtual Year Book    Far be it from me , lowly blogger, to impede the progress of all the  primping  and  preening  that goes on among the chattering classes. I mean, they do deserve their time to waddle in the sun being as they explain reality to the rest of the world daily, via their nesting centers in NY, DC and LA, and occasionally  urlLink Davos  and Sundance.  Sometimes the chattering class appear to be unruly students at  urlLink J K Rowlings'  mythical  Hogwarts , struggling in childlike wonder with The Great Questions of Good and Evil --- naked ambition versus the ermine robes of state.  Imagine, if you will,  urlLink Eisner  or, say,  Michael Powell , as  urlLink Voldemortian  forces lying in wait in support of media consolidation! Not too much of a wizarding stretch, I hope.  Now,  take away the element of magic  and at other times, The Chattering Classes appear to be not unlike the  urlLink birds . Imagine if you will,  Barry Diller  a  urlLink heron , or  Anna Wintour  a  urlLink swan , pecking at a salad,  Jayson Blair  (averted gaze) a  urlLink turkey  ("performs distraction display") and  Harvey Weinstein  an  urlLink American Kestrel  ("Pale belly"). My bird's eye view. That's just how  The Corsair's  fevered media-oversaturated imagination works: all  wizards and warblers .  The Chattering Class render their ideas in varying forms of, uhm, media: sometimes they use the standard black and white print, often radio waves, other times tv, glossy mags are the usual, even mini studios--  whatever  the means of communication, there is some hawkish champion ready to express themselves, so, in the end, it is  difficult  to characterize The Mediaratti fully as the variety of media are matched only by the infinitude of styles and thought, limited only by the imagination; and, of course, I don't intend (or  pre tend) to be the last word on the matter-- neither as Hogwarts' sorting hat nor as Audubonian birder on the prowl.  Nor  do I, in any way, mean this to be a  complete list , but only a partial listing of those flapping wings who have crossed my radar screen.   So, like the snarky and chaotic (I think the very cool  urlLink Choire  called me absolutely mad, and I don't dispute that claim)  urlLink Gemini  that I am, allow me to mix my metaphors, combining Rowlings and Ravens, to try and draw a bede on these venerable birds.    Basta , now let's just coalesce all the necessary, fluttering data, my little pomegranates, and see if we cannot usher these rara avis into an aviary fitting for public  consumption , uhm -- only  urlLink the catty consume birds  -- public  observation .   And so , I present, as it were, on the fly, a virtual HS yearbook (the school song a martial, Murdochian anthem, possibly in  urlLink Mandarin Chinese ?), without the pictures:   For your pleasure ,  urlLink Rupert Murdoch  HS, Class of 2004 (stands at attention, hums anthem solemnly):   roll credits    Who's Who :   Barry Diller , Headmaster,  urlLink Dumbledoresque  mogul standing athwart  urlLink media consolidation  ... white  urlLink tailed tropic bird ("In pursuit of fish and squid, tropicbirds engage in graceful dives from the air.")   urlLink Don Imus  ... shifty-eyed leathery janitorial-type (think of the creepy Carl the Janitor in  urlLink The Breakfast Club ) ...  urlLink Masked Booby  ("a variety of hissing and quacking notes on breeding grounds") ...  urlLink Slytherin  ...

 The Chattering Class Virtual Year Book    Far be it from me , lowly blogger, to impede the progress of all the  primping  and  preening  that goes on among the chattering classes. I mean, they do deserve their time to waddle in the sun being as they explain reality to the rest of the world daily, via their nesting centers in NY, DC and LA, and occasionally  urlLink Davos  and Sundance.  Sometimes the chattering class appear to be unruly students at  urlLink J K Rowlings'  mythical  Hogwarts , struggling in childlike wonder with The Great Questions of Good and Evil --- naked ambition versus the ermine robes of state.  Imagine, if you will,  urlLink Eisner  or, say,  Michael Powell , as  urlLink Voldemortian  forces lying in wait in support of media consolidation! Not too much of a wizarding stretch, I hope.  Now,  take away the element of magic  and at other times, The Chattering Classes appear to be not unlike the  urlLink birds . Imagine if you will,  Barry Diller  a  urlLink heron , or  Anna Wintour  a  urlLink swan , pecking at a salad,  Jayson Blair  (averted gaze) a  urlLink turkey  ("performs distraction display") and  Harvey Weinstein  an  urlLink American Kestrel  ("Pale belly"). My bird's eye view. That's just how  The Corsair's  fevered media-oversaturated imagination works: all  wizards and warblers .  The Chattering Class render their ideas in varying forms of, uhm, media: sometimes they use the standard black and white print, often radio waves, other times tv, glossy mags are the usual, even mini studios--  whatever  the means of communication, there is some hawkish champion ready to express themselves, so, in the end, it is  difficult  to characterize The Mediaratti fully as the variety of media are matched only by the infinitude of styles and thought, limited only by the imagination; and, of course, I don't intend (or  pre tend) to be the last word on the matter-- neither as Hogwarts' sorting hat nor as Audubonian birder on the prowl.  Nor  do I, in any way, mean this to be a  complete list , but only a partial listing of those flapping wings who have crossed my radar screen.   So, like the snarky and chaotic (I think the very cool  urlLink Choire  called me absolutely mad, and I don't dispute that claim)  urlLink Gemini  that I am, allow me to mix my metaphors, combining Rowlings and Ravens, to try and draw a bede on these venerable birds.    Basta , now let's just coalesce all the necessary, fluttering data, my little pomegranates, and see if we cannot usher these rara avis into an aviary fitting for public  consumption , uhm -- only  urlLink the catty consume birds  -- public  observation .   And so , I present, as it were, on the fly, a virtual HS yearbook (the school song a martial, Murdochian anthem, possibly in  urlLink Mandarin Chinese ?), without the pictures:   For your pleasure ,  urlLink Rupert Murdoch  HS, Class of 2004 (stands at attention, hums anthem solemnly):   roll credits    Who's Who :   Barry Diller , Headmaster,  urlLink Dumbledoresque  mogul standing athwart  urlLink media consolidation  ... white  urlLink tailed tropic bird ("In pursuit of fish and squid, tropicbirds engage in graceful dives from the air.")   urlLink Don Imus  ... shifty-eyed leathery janitorial-type (think of the creepy Carl the Janitor in  urlLink The Breakfast Club ) ...  urlLink Masked Booby  ("a variety of hissing and quacking notes on breeding grounds") ...  urlLink Slytherin  ...

 The Chattering Class Virtual Year Book    Far be it from me , lowly blogger, to impede the progress of all the  primping  and  preening  that goes on among the chattering classes. I mean, they do deserve their time to waddle in the sun being as they explain reality to the rest of the world daily, via their nesting centers in NY, DC and LA, and occasionally  urlLink Davos  and Sundance.  Sometimes the chattering class appear to be unruly students at  urlLink J K Rowlings'  mythical  Hogwarts , struggling in childlike wonder with The Great Questions of Good and Evil --- naked ambition versus the ermine robes of state.  Imagine, if you will,  urlLink Eisner  or, say,  Michael Powell , as  urlLink Voldemortian  forces lying in wait in support of media consolidation! Not too much of a wizarding stretch, I hope.  Now,  take away the element of magic  and at other times, The Chattering Classes appear to be not unlike the  urlLink birds . Imagine if you will,  Barry Diller  a  urlLink heron , or  Anna Wintour  a  urlLink swan , pecking at a salad,  Jayson Blair  (averted gaze) a  urlLink turkey  ("performs distraction display") and  Harvey Weinstein  an  urlLink American Kestrel  ("Pale belly"). My bird's eye view. That's just how  The Corsair's  fevered media-oversaturated imagination works: all  wizards and warblers .  The Chattering Class render their ideas in varying forms of, uhm, media: sometimes they use the standard black and white print, often radio waves, other times tv, glossy mags are the usual, even mini studios--  whatever  the means of communication, there is some hawkish champion ready to express themselves, so, in the end, it is  difficult  to characterize The Mediaratti fully as the variety of media are matched only by the infinitude of styles and thought, limited only by the imagination; and, of course, I don't intend (or  pre tend) to be the last word on the matter-- neither as Hogwarts' sorting hat nor as Audubonian birder on the prowl.  Nor  do I, in any way, mean this to be a  complete list , but only a partial listing of those flapping wings who have crossed my radar screen.   So, like the snarky and chaotic (I think the very cool  urlLink Choire  called me absolutely mad, and I don't dispute that claim)  urlLink Gemini  that I am, allow me to mix my metaphors, combining Rowlings and Ravens, to try and draw a bede on these venerable birds.    Basta , now let's just coalesce all the necessary, fluttering data, my little pomegranates, and see if we cannot usher these rara avis into an aviary fitting for public  consumption , uhm -- only  urlLink the catty consume birds  -- public  observation .   And so , I present, as it were, on the fly, a virtual HS yearbook (the school song a martial, Murdochian anthem, possibly in  urlLink Mandarin Chinese ?), without the pictures:   For your pleasure ,  urlLink Rupert Murdoch  HS, Class of 2004 (stands at attention, hums anthem solemnly):   roll credits    Who's Who :   Barry Diller , Headmaster,  urlLink Dumbledoresque  mogul standing athwart  urlLink media consolidation  ... white  urlLink tailed tropic bird ("In pursuit of fish and squid, tropicbirds engage in graceful dives from the air.")   urlLink Don Imus  ... shifty-eyed leathery janitorial-type (think of the creepy Carl the Janitor in  urlLink The Breakfast Club ) ...  urlLink Masked Booby  ("a variety of hissing and quacking notes on breeding grounds") ...  urlLink Slytherin  ...

 The Chattering Class Virtual Year Book    Far be it from me , lowly blogger, to impede the progress of all the  primping  and  preening  that goes on among the chattering classes. I mean, they do deserve their time to waddle in the sun being as they explain reality to the rest of the world daily, via their nesting centers in NY, DC and LA, and occasionally  urlLink Davos  and Sundance.  Sometimes the chattering class appear to be unruly students at  urlLink J K Rowlings'  mythical  Hogwarts , struggling in childlike wonder with The Great Questions of Good and Evil --- naked ambition versus the ermine robes of state.  Imagine, if you will,  urlLink Eisner  or, say,  Michael Powell , as  urlLink Voldemortian  forces lying in wait in support of media consolidation! Not too much of a wizarding stretch, I hope.  Now,  take away the element of magic  and at other times, The Chattering Classes appear to be not unlike the  urlLink birds . Imagine if you will,  Barry Diller  a  urlLink heron , or  Anna Wintour  a  urlLink swan , pecking at a salad,  Jayson Blair  (averted gaze) a  urlLink turkey  ("performs distraction display") and  Harvey Weinstein  an  urlLink American Kestrel  ("Pale belly"). My bird's eye view. That's just how  The Corsair's  fevered media-oversaturated imagination works: all  wizards and warblers .  The Chattering Class render their ideas in varying forms of, uhm, media: sometimes they use the standard black and white print, often radio waves, other times tv, glossy mags are the usual, even mini studios--  whatever  the means of communication, there is some hawkish champion ready to express themselves, so, in the end, it is  difficult  to characterize The Mediaratti fully as the variety of media are matched only by the infinitude of styles and thought, limited only by the imagination; and, of course, I don't intend (or  pre tend) to be the last word on the matter-- neither as Hogwarts' sorting hat nor as Audubonian birder on the prowl.  Nor  do I, in any way, mean this to be a  complete list , but only a partial listing of those flapping wings who have crossed my radar screen.   So, like the snarky and chaotic (I think the very cool  urlLink Choire  called me absolutely mad, and I don't dispute that claim)  urlLink Gemini  that I am, allow me to mix my metaphors, combining Rowlings and Ravens, to try and draw a bede on these venerable birds.    Basta , now let's just coalesce all the necessary, fluttering data, my little pomegranates, and see if we cannot usher these rara avis into an aviary fitting for public  consumption , uhm -- only  urlLink the catty consume birds  -- public  observation .   And so , I present, as it were, on the fly, a virtual HS yearbook (the school song a martial, Murdochian anthem, possibly in  urlLink Mandarin Chinese ?), without the pictures:   For your pleasure ,  urlLink Rupert Murdoch  HS, Class of 2004 (stands at attention, hums anthem solemnly):   roll credits    Who's Who :   Barry Diller , Headmaster,  urlLink Dumbledoresque  mogul standing athwart  urlLink media consolidation  ... white  urlLink tailed tropic bird ("In pursuit of fish and squid, tropicbirds engage in graceful dives from the air.")   urlLink Don Imus  ... shifty-eyed leathery janitorial-type (think of the creepy Carl the Janitor in  urlLink The Breakfast Club ) ...  urlLink Masked Booby  ("a variety of hissing and quacking notes on breeding grounds") ...  urlLink Slytherin  ...

 The Chattering Class Virtual Year Book    Far be it from me , lowly blogger, to impede the progress of all the  primping  and  preening  that goes on among the chattering classes. I mean, they do deserve their time to waddle in the sun being as they explain reality to the rest of the world daily, via their nesting centers in NY, DC and LA, and occasionally  urlLink Davos  and Sundance.  Sometimes the chattering class appear to be unruly students at  urlLink J K Rowlings'  mythical  Hogwarts , struggling in childlike wonder with The Great Questions of Good and Evil --- naked ambition versus the ermine robes of state.  Imagine, if you will,  urlLink Eisner  or, say,  Michael Powell , as  urlLink Voldemortian  forces lying in wait in support of media consolidation! Not too much of a wizarding stretch, I hope.  Now,  take away the element of magic  and at other times, The Chattering Classes appear to be not unlike the  urlLink birds . Imagine if you will,  Barry Diller  a  urlLink heron , or  Anna Wintour  a  urlLink swan , pecking at a salad,  Jayson Blair  (averted gaze) a  urlLink turkey  ("performs distraction display") and  Harvey Weinstein  an  urlLink American Kestrel  ("Pale belly"). My bird's eye view. That's just how  The Corsair's  fevered media-oversaturated imagination works: all  wizards and warblers .  The Chattering Class render their ideas in varying forms of, uhm, media: sometimes they use the standard black and white print, often radio waves, other times tv, glossy mags are the usual, even mini studios--  whatever  the means of communication, there is some hawkish champion ready to express themselves, so, in the end, it is  difficult  to characterize The Mediaratti fully as the variety of media are matched only by the infinitude of styles and thought, limited only by the imagination; and, of course, I don't intend (or  pre tend) to be the last word on the matter-- neither as Hogwarts' sorting hat nor as Audubonian birder on the prowl.  Nor  do I, in any way, mean this to be a  complete list , but only a partial listing of those flapping wings who have crossed my radar screen.   So, like the snarky and chaotic (I think the very cool  urlLink Choire  called me absolutely mad, and I don't dispute that claim)  urlLink Gemini  that I am, allow me to mix my metaphors, combining Rowlings and Ravens, to try and draw a bede on these venerable birds.    Basta , now let's just coalesce all the necessary, fluttering data, my little pomegranates, and see if we cannot usher these rara avis into an aviary fitting for public  consumption , uhm -- only  urlLink the catty consume birds  -- public  observation .   And so , I present, as it were, on the fly, a virtual HS yearbook (the school song a martial, Murdochian anthem, possibly in  urlLink Mandarin Chinese ?), without the pictures:   For your pleasure ,  urlLink Rupert Murdoch  HS, Class of 2004 (stands at attention, hums anthem solemnly):   roll credits    Who's Who :   Barry Diller , Headmaster,  urlLink Dumbledoresque  mogul standing athwart  urlLink media consolidation  ... white  urlLink tailed tropic bird ("In pursuit of fish and squid, tropicbirds engage in graceful dives from the air.")   urlLink Don Imus  ... shifty-eyed leathery janitorial-type (think of the creepy Carl the Janitor in  urlLink The Breakfast Club ) ...  urlLink Masked Booby  ("a variety of hissing and quacking notes on breeding grounds") ...  urlLink Slytherin  ...

And so , I present, as it were, on the fly, a virtual HS yearbook (the school song a martial, Murdochian anthem, possibly in  urlLink Mandarin Chinese ?), without the pictures:   For your pleasure ,  urlLink Rupert Murdoch  HS, Class of 2004 (stands at attention, hums anthem solemnly):   roll credits    Who's Who :   Barry Diller , Headmaster,  urlLink Dumbledoresque  mogul standing athwart  urlLink media consolidation  ... white  urlLink tailed tropic bird ("In pursuit of fish and squid, tropicbirds engage in graceful dives from the air.")   urlLink Don Imus  ... shifty-eyed leathery janitorial-type (think of the creepy Carl the Janitor in  urlLink The Breakfast Club ) ...  urlLink Masked Booby  ("a variety of hissing and quacking notes on breeding grounds") ...  urlLink Slytherin  ...

 The Chattering Class Virtual Year Book    Far be it from me , lowly blogger, to impede the progress of all the  primping  and  preening  that goes on among the chattering classes. I mean, they do deserve their time to waddle in the sun being as they explain reality to the rest of the world daily, via their nesting centers in NY, DC and LA, and occasionally  urlLink Davos  and Sundance.  Sometimes the chattering class appear to be unruly students at  urlLink J K Rowlings'  mythical  Hogwarts , struggling in childlike wonder with The Great Questions of Good and Evil --- naked ambition versus the ermine robes of state.  Imagine, if you will,  urlLink Eisner  or, say,  Michael Powell , as  urlLink Voldemortian  forces lying in wait in support of media consolidation! Not too much of a wizarding stretch, I hope.  Now,  take away the element of magic  and at other times, The Chattering Classes appear to be not unlike the  urlLink birds . Imagine if you will,  Barry Diller  a  urlLink heron , or  Anna Wintour  a  urlLink swan , pecking at a salad,  Jayson Blair  (averted gaze) a  urlLink turkey  ("performs distraction display") and  Harvey Weinstein  an  urlLink American Kestrel  ("Pale belly"). My bird's eye view. That's just how  The Corsair's  fevered media-oversaturated imagination works: all  wizards and warblers .  The Chattering Class render their ideas in varying forms of, uhm, media: sometimes they use the standard black and white print, often radio waves, other times tv, glossy mags are the usual, even mini studios--  whatever  the means of communication, there is some hawkish champion ready to express themselves, so, in the end, it is  difficult  to characterize The Mediaratti fully as the variety of media are matched only by the infinitude of styles and thought, limited only by the imagination; and, of course, I don't intend (or  pre tend) to be the last word on the matter-- neither as Hogwarts' sorting hat nor as Audubonian birder on the prowl.  Nor  do I, in any way, mean this to be a  complete list , but only a partial listing of those flapping wings who have crossed my radar screen.   So, like the snarky and chaotic (I think the very cool  urlLink Choire  called me absolutely mad, and I don't dispute that claim)  urlLink Gemini  that I am, allow me to mix my metaphors, combining Rowlings and Ravens, to try and draw a bede on these venerable birds.    Basta , now let's just coalesce all the necessary, fluttering data, my little pomegranates, and see if we cannot usher these rara avis into an aviary fitting for public  consumption , uhm -- only  urlLink the catty consume birds  -- public  observation .   And so , I present, as it were, on the fly, a virtual HS yearbook (the school song a martial, Murdochian anthem, possibly in  urlLink Mandarin Chinese ?), without the pictures:   For your pleasure ,  urlLink Rupert Murdoch  HS, Class of 2004 (stands at attention, hums anthem solemnly):   roll credits    Who's Who :   Barry Diller , Headmaster,  urlLink Dumbledoresque  mogul standing athwart  urlLink media consolidation  ... white  urlLink tailed tropic bird ("In pursuit of fish and squid, tropicbirds engage in graceful dives from the air.")   urlLink Don Imus  ... shifty-eyed leathery janitorial-type (think of the creepy Carl the Janitor in  urlLink The Breakfast Club ) ...  urlLink Masked Booby  ("a variety of hissing and quacking notes on breeding grounds") ...  urlLink Slytherin  ...
